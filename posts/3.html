                <h2>a decade on tumblr.com</h2>
                <p>I’ve had tumblr since 2013. this year, my blog aged 10 years in may. tumblr has always been a constant for me, even when for some periods of time I didn’t use it consistently as others. for the last 10 years, I’ve been reblogging, posting original content, and organizing media on my blog that once belonged to a 12 year old girl. now, it belongs to a young adult woman. this progression is shown in the condensed archive feature of tumblr.</p>
                <br>
                <p>now, I feel more contented with my sense of self and style than ever before, which is a relaxing thought. however, when I was 12 and had unlimited access to the internet, I, like millions of other teenage girls, was exposed to the ideas of “aesthetics” and fitting ourselves into a certain brand of girl. in middle school boys teased me and called “tumblr girl!” after me; it was mostly fun in games — fun to be recognized as a type of girl at all, and games to yell back at them, giving them the reaction they sought. it was also humorous to me at the time because I was actually beginning to gain a small following on the site. by the end of middle school, I was nearing 5k followers in 2013. on tumblr, this doesn’t mean much, really. a following on this site is next to nothing, it rarely translates to any other platform successfully. although, for a 13-year-old girl who just wanted to belong to a community, it satisfied a need.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I hit 20k followers on tumblr in high school, circa 2017ish. this was the peak of the art hoe/indie girl aesthetic. I had been extremely active on the site for the last four years prior, alternating between a few niches and styles, but mainly sticking to one general theme revolving around art, interior design, fashion, nature, city living, writing, poetry, and music I liked. these are pretty much the same kind of things I reblog/post today. in these first six or so years of having a tumblr, I normally had a queue set up to post around the clock. it was common for popular tumblr blogs to do this to keep their accounts active and followers engaged. it seems really goofy now, like we took this shit way too seriously (and we did). but I also see why we all did it, now as I am an adult on tumblr with no queue (because I am an adult who doesn’t have time to sit down and set a tumblr queue every week, selecting through thousands of archived photos from other similar blogs). present day, I think most tumblr users don’t have time for preparing queues, thus, my dashboard (feed/timeline) is often dead. sometimes it goes over 48 hours with none of the blogs I follow posting anything new (I follow 739 blogs, which lots of are probably from my youth and inactive now). versus, when we all had queues, it was possible to spend endless amounts of time on the site, powered by genuine human interest and actions, not an algorithm. </p>
                <br>
                <p>if you do attempt to doomscroll on tumblr now when your feed is dead, don’t fear! tumblr does now offer a “for you” dashboard. classic. of course they do, right? so they can harvest data and present you with what matches your brand best, so you’ll keep coming back. what do you mostly reblog? writing/poetry/sad girl things, clean girl imagery, grunge-inspired photography, screen grabs from your favorite shows and movies? whatever it is, once you reblog it once off of your for you feed, tumblr will show you a mass amount of that specific type of media/content you engaged with. it becomes obvious through use that the tumblr for you algorithm isn’t as advanced or as varied as tik tok or instagram. with minimal user use on tumblr in 2023, it can be kind of boring, and I get it. I wish we would all start using it again and save this eternally overlooked site, but I digress, that’s not really the point of this particular essay. (if anyone wants to spearhead that mission though, tag me) (I also don’t want to negate the issues with the site as well, such as p*rn bots and spam accounts, which tumblr has had a notoriously difficult time combatting over the years).</p>
                <br>
                <p>it is interesting how we still see tumblr content being passed around the internet nowadays, regardless of the site’s all-time active-user low. we will see tumblr’s content for decades to come whether the site dies or not. screenshots of text posts are burned into our brains, funny one-liners perpetually referenced. (example: most  joshpeck.tumblr.com text posts) (not really josh peck). present day, most tumblr content outside of tumblr that I see exists on tik tok. screenshots of tumblr posts are shared in photo slides, commonly being posted by young girls and women. I am one of them. what can I say? I’m just trying to bring the knowledge to the people. I hope we all keep creating this type of content cumulation, but I also hope real people start using tumblr again.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I tried on many aesthetic hats in my early years on tumblr. lots of my style and other outside influences over time are reflected in my tumblr archives, which you can see on relatively any tumblr blog by adding “/archive” to the end of the url.</p>
